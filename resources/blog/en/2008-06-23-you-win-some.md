title: You win some, you lose some, you talk some
categories: Scrabble presentation
---

After my [shameful performance][1] in the previous tournament, this weekend saw my greatest achievement in tournament Scrabble to date: that of advancing to the quarterfinals of the Cup of Poland. For the record, [here][2] are the final standings. In the quarterfinal, I lost both games to Tomasz Zwoliński (the former Champion of Poland), who went on to win the Cup.

On Thursday, I will be delivering a presentation about the dark side of programming: error handling and how to cope up with Murphy’s law. The talk will last around 30 minutes and be held within [TechAula][3], a place to hear about exciting and revolutionary technologies in software engineering. Feel invited to register and show up.

(Postscriptum 11 July: By public demand, the slides from my talk are now [available for download][4].)
