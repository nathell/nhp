title: Another metapost

No, I am not going to write about [the programming language for generating vector graphics][1].
This is not a real post, but rather a note to self to write ones on certain topics once I get ready for that. And as for today’s title, I just couldn’t resist the pun. ;-)

I’ve been rewriting the Poliqarp Java (GUI) client for the last two weeks or so. The point is to convert it to use [the new protocol][2], and to take the opportunity of turning a messy, kludgey and bit-rotting pile of code into a neatly decoupled, cleanly designed, robust and comprehensible utility. And the further I get, the more I see how much it’s worth it. I strongly believe that at the end of this path, upon remergence with the mainline, Poliqarp will become better than ever before.

Thus, when I have something to show (I hope to deliver a preliminary working version, though not yet feature-complete, within the upcoming week or so), I will probably brag about the design solutions I’ve taken. While I’m at it, I will possibly also write the long-delayed description of the new build system.

If there is anybody out there besides me who actually cares for that, stay tuned!
