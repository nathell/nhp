I’ve just packaged up the Common Lisp netstring handling code that I [wrote a week ago][1] into a neat library. Unsurprisingly enough, it is called cl-netstrings and has its own [home on the Web][2]. It’s even asdf-installable! I wonder whether this one turns out to be useful for anybody besides me…

The other thing I’ve been working on is a new build system for Poliqarp. But that’s the story for another post — most probably I will write about it when it gets out of a state of constant flux.

_Update 2010-Jan-17_: cl-netstrings is now hosted on GitHub; I’ve updated the link.
