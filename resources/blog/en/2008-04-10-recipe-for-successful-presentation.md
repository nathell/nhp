title: Recipe for a successful presentation
categories: LaTeX presentation typography
---

[LaTeX][1] + [Beamer][2] (for typesetting the presentation in a visually pleasant, clean, simple and consistent way) + [KeyJNote][3] (for presenting it stylishly to the audience) = a recipe for success. In particular, KeyJNote, which I found only yesterday, seems to be a fine and tremendously useful piece of software, despite being very young. The only annoyance I have found in it is that it doesn’t respond to Alt-Tab when in fullscreen mode. On the typographical side, I used the [progressbar][4] Beamer theme and the [Torunian Antiqua][5] font, both to great effect.

While I’m at this topic, [Jan Rychter][6] has recently posted [a great guide to giving presentations][7], especially short ones. I heartily recommend it to those of you who speak Polish (is there actually any non-Polish-speaking person reading this?)

_Update 2010-Jan-17_: KeyJNote is now called [Impressive][8].
